# Bilinear Multi-Layer Perceptrons (BMLP) for Hierarchical Single-Cell Analysis

A novel machine learning approach for discovering interpretable gene regulatory hierarchies in single-cell RNA-seq data through bilinear neural networks and graph Laplacian eigendecomposition.

## üß¨ Concept

Traditional single-cell analysis methods rely on correlation-based approaches to identify gene programs and cell states. This project introduces a fundamentally different approach that captures **gene-gene interactions** rather than simple co-expression patterns.

### Core Innovation

- **Bilinear Interactions**: Instead of linear transformations, we use bilinear operations that model pairwise gene interactions: `(Wx) ‚äô (Vx) ‚Üí B ‚àà ‚Ñù^(g√óg)`
- **Frequency Hierarchy**: We decompose the cell-cell similarity graph using Laplacian eigenvectors, creating natural frequency scales that correspond to biological hierarchies
- **Interpretable Weights**: The learned bilinear matrices encode gene regulatory modules at different transcriptional scales

### Biological Intuition

Each output dimension represents a level of phenotypic hierarchy:
- **Low frequencies (0-1)**: Broad developmental processes (cell fate, differentiation)
- **Middle frequencies (2-3)**: Lineage-specific pathways (myeloid vs erythroid)  
- **High frequencies (4+)**: Fine-grained cell type markers (neutrophil vs monocyte)

The interaction matrices `B[freq]` represent gene modules sufficient to distinguish between branches at each hierarchical level.

## üöÄ Key Benefits

1. **Non-linear & Interpretable**: Captures complex gene regulatory logic while maintaining interpretability
2. **Hierarchical by Design**: Natural multi-scale analysis of cellular phenotypes
3. **Beyond Correlations**: Discovers gene interactions that correlation methods miss
4. **Biologically Grounded**: Frequency decomposition aligns with developmental timescales

## üìä Validation Results

Our approach shows significant advantages over traditional correlation-based methods:

- **Low Jaccard Similarity (0.118)**: Demonstrates that bilinear interactions capture fundamentally different biology than simple correlations
- **GO Term Enrichment**: Gene modules show strong enrichment for relevant biological processes at each frequency
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Clear progression from broad developmental programs to specific cell type markers

## üß™ Quick Start

```python
import scanpy as sc
import numpy as np
from datasets import myeloid_dev_freq
from bmlp import ScBMLPRegressor, Config

# Load data with frequency decomposition
adata, train_dataset, val_dataset, test_dataset = myeloid_dev_freq(
    device="cpu", 
    k_neighbors=10,
    n_freq_comps=5
)

# Configure and train the model
cfg = Config(
    d_input=adata.n_vars,
    d_hidden=128,
    d_output=5,  # Number of frequency components
    n_epochs=500,
    lr=1e-4
)

model = ScBMLPRegressor(cfg, loss_fn="l1")
train_losses, val_losses = model.fit(train_dataset, val_dataset)

# Extract interpretable gene modules
import einops
b = einops.einsum(model.w_p, model.w_l, model.w_r, "out hid, hid in1, hid in2 -> out in1 in2")
b = 0.5 * (b + b.mT)  # Symmetrize

# Analyze gene modules at each frequency
for freq_idx in range(5):
    vals, vecs = torch.linalg.eigh(b[freq_idx])
    vals, vecs = vals.flip([0]), vecs.flip([1])
    
    # Get top genes for this frequency
    top_genes = adata.var_names[vecs[:, 0].topk(20).indices]
    print(f"Frequency {freq_idx} genes: {top_genes.tolist()}")
```
